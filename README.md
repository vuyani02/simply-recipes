Simply Recipes

This is a highly responsive website I developed to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I followed a tutorial on YouTube, but instead of copying everything step by step, I first cloned some features on my own and then watched the video to learn more efficient techniques.

The main purpose of this project was to improve my mobile-first responsive design skills.
